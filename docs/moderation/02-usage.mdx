# Usage

## Basic commands

To get started, the basic commands are as you might expect. You can ban, warn,
and mute one or multiple members. Just pass more mentions or IDs and make sure
your (optional) reason is after them! IDs and mentions can both be
interchangably used.

<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="moderator">

    <DiscordMessage bot author="sushii" avatar="/img/sushii_avatar.png">

Ban, mute, warn, and note commands all work the same. The only difference is for
mutes you can also add a duration in the reason to make the mute timed. This
will tell sushii to automatically unmute them after the given duration.

:::note

Mute and warn commands will by default DM the user the reason (and duration for
mutes). You can disable this for mutes in settings if you do not want sushii to
DM the targeted user. If you have some information related to a user you only
want other moderators to see and to have it show up in their `history`, you can
use the `note` command.

:::

:::caution

The `ban` command does **not** delete any messages. In order to ban and delete
messages, use the native Discord ban menu then set the reason afterwards. This
also allows for flexibility and speed when there is the urgent need to remove
a user and their messages.

:::

If you ban, mute, or warn a user without an initial reason, or if you use
Discord's native ban menu, you can set the ban reason. You can either use the
case number which you can find in the moderation log, or use `latest`. To set
multiple latest case reasons, include the number of cases as shown below.

## User History

Wondering if a member is a repeating troublemaker? Use the `history` command to
see all past moderator actions on them.

<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="moderator">-history 890123456789010</DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage bot author="sushii" avatar="/img/sushii_avatar.png">
        <DiscordEmbed slot="embeds" embed-title="Attempted to ban 4 users">
            ðŸ”¨ user#0000 (890123456789010) banned.
            <br />
            ðŸ”¨ user#0001 (890123456789011) banned.

## Lookup

Have a new member that is suspicious? Look up their ban history across all
servers sushii is in.

:::info

The `lookup` command is **opt-in** only. Sushii will not share any of your
server details unless you opt-in to sharing, which will also allow you to see
other servers that have opted in. You can still use the `lookup` command without
opting into detail sharing, but information will be limited.

:::

Some servers may have icons to differentiate between their statuses. Servers are
always ordered by highest server members to lowest to determine how much
consideration you should put into certain ban reasons. Servers with low member
counts are hidden to prevent abuse.
