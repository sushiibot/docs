# Setup

Example set up commands are shown below. A full command reference can be found in the commands list.

## Set log channels

<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="User">
        -settings modlog set{" "}
        <DiscordMention type="channel">mod-log</DiscordMention>
    </DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage bot author="sushii" avatar="/img/sushii_avatar.png">
        Updated mod log to:{" "}
        <DiscordMention type="channel">mod-log</DiscordMention>
    </DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage author="User">
        -settings msglog set{" "}
        <DiscordMention type="channel">message-log</DiscordMention>
    </DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage bot author="sushii" avatar="/img/sushii_avatar.png">
        Updated message log to:{" "}
        <DiscordMention type="channel">message-log</DiscordMention>
    </DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage author="User">

        Updated member log to:{" "}
        <DiscordMention type="channel">member-log</DiscordMention>
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

## Set mute role

Set your mute role to let sushii keep track of when members are muted and
automatically mute/unmute. Note that you need to set the corresponding mute role
permissions yourself for the time being (eg manually setting permissions to
disable message sending permissions).

<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="User">-settings mute role Mute</DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage bot author="sushii" avatar="/img/sushii_avatar.png">
        Updated mute role to ID 747155433655107594
    </DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage author="User">
        -settings mute defaultduration 1d
    </DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage bot author="sushii" avatar="/img/sushii_avatar.png">
        Set the default mute duration to 1day
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

## Set join messages

<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="User">
        -settings msgchannel set{" "}
        <DiscordMention type="channel">general</DiscordMention>
    </DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage bot author="sushii" avatar="/img/sushii_avatar.png">
        Updated message channel to:{" "}
        <DiscordMention type="channel">general</DiscordMention>
    </DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage author="User">
        -settings joinmsg set Welcome &lt;mention&gt; to &lt;server&gt; (member
        #&lt;member_number&gt;)!
    </DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage bot author="sushii" avatar="/img/sushii_avatar.png">
        Updated join message to: Welcome &lt;mention&gt; to &lt;server&gt;
        (member #&lt;member_number&gt;)!
    </DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage author="User">-settings joinreact set ðŸ‘‹</DiscordMessage>
    <DiscordMessage bot author="sushii" avatar="/img/sushii_avatar.png">
        Updated join react to: ðŸ‘‹
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

<br />

When a new member joins, sushii will send the following message.

<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage bot author="sushii" avatar="/img/sushii_avatar.png">
        Welcome <DiscordMention>User</DiscordMention> to My Server! (member
        #129)!
        <DiscordReactions slot="reactions">
            <DiscordReaction
                name="ðŸ‘‹"
                emoji="/img/emoji/wave.svg"
                count={1}
            ></DiscordReaction>
        </DiscordReactions>
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
