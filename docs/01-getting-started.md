# Getting Started

## Add sushii

First things first, make sure you have sushii added to your server! You can add
it with this link.

## Ensure permissions are correct

Make sure sushii's automatically created role is in the correct position. It
should be above the roles for users you want sushii to apply actions to, ie
bans, mutes, auto assigns, etc.
